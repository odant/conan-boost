# Usage Examples
:idprefix: usage_

All of the following examples assume that these lines
```
#include <boost/system.hpp>
namespace sys = boost::system;
```
are in effect.

## Returning Errors from OS APIs under POSIX

Let's suppose that we're implementing a portable `file` wrapper
over the OS file APIs. Its general outline is shown below:

```
class file
{
private:

    int fd_;

public:

    // ...

    std::size_t read( void * buffer, std::size_t size, sys::error_code& ec );
    std::size_t write( void const * buffer, std::size_t size, sys::error_code& ec );
};
```

Since we're implementing the POSIX version of `file`, its
data member is a POSIX file descriptor `int fd_;`, although other
implementations will differ.

Our `read` and `write` functions return the number of bytes transferred, and signal
errors via the output parameter `ec`, of type `boost::system::error_code`.

An implementation of `file::read` might look like this:

```
std::size_t file::read( void * buffer, std::size_t size, sys::error_code& ec )
{
    ssize_t r = ::read( fd_, buffer, size );

    if( r < 0 )
    {
        ec.assign( errno, sys::system_category() );
        return 0;
    }

    ec = {}; // ec.clear(); under C++03
    return r;
}
```

We first call the POSIX API `read`; if it returns an error, we store the `errno`
value in `ec`, using the system category, and return 0 as bytes transferred.
Otherwise, we clear `ec` to signal success, and return the result of `::read`.

NOTE: Clearing `ec` on successful returns is an important step; do not omit it.

Under POSIX, the system category corresponds to POSIX `errno` values, which is
why we use it.

In principle, since the generic category _also_ corresponds to `errno` values
under all platforms, we could have used it here; however, by convention under
POSIX, if the `errno` value comes from the OS (the "system"), we use the system
category for it. That's because the system category values may be a
platform-specific superset of the generic (platform-independent) values.

The implementation of `file::write` is basically the same. We show it here for
completeness:

```
std::size_t file::write( void const * buffer, std::size_t size, sys::error_code& ec )
{
    ssize_t r = ::write( fd_, buffer, size );

    if( r < 0 )
    {
        ec.assign( errno, sys::system_category() );
        return 0;
    }

    ec = {}; // ec.clear(); under C++03
    return r;
}
```

## Returning Errors from OS APIs under Windows

Under Windows, our `file` object will store a `HANDLE` instead of an `int`:

```
class file
{
private:

    HANDLE fh_;

public:

    // as before
};
```

and the implementation of `file::read` will look like this:

```
std::size_t file::read( void * buffer, std::size_t size, sys::error_code& ec )
{
    DWORD r = 0;

    if( ::ReadFile( fh_, buffer, size, &r, 0 ) )
    {
        // success
        ec = {}; // ec.clear(); under C++03
    }
    else
    {
        // failure
        ec.assign( ::GetLastError(), sys::system_category() );
    }

    // In both cases, r is bytes transferred
    return r;
}
```

Here, the system category corresponds to the values defined in the system
header `<winerror.h>` and returned by `GetLastError()`. Since we use the
Win32 API `ReadFile` to implement `file::read`, and it returns the error
code via `GetLastError()`, we again store that value in `ec` as belonging
to the system category.

The implementation of `file::write` is, again, the same.

```
std::size_t file::write( void const * buffer, std::size_t size, sys::error_code& ec )
{
    DWORD r = 0;

    if( ::WriteFile( fh_, buffer, size, &r, 0 ) )
    {
        ec = {}; // ec.clear(); under C++03
    }
    else
    {
        ec.assign( ::GetLastError(), sys::system_category() );
    }

    return r;
}
```

## Returning Specific Errors under POSIX

Our implementation of `file::read` has a problem; it accepts `std::size_t`
values for `size`, but the behavior of `::read` is unspecified when the
requested value does not fit in `ssize_t`. To avoid reliance on unspecified
behavior, let's add a check for this condition and return an error:

```
std::size_t file::read( void * buffer, std::size_t size, sys::error_code& ec )
{
    if( size > SSIZE_MAX )
    {
        ec.assign( EINVAL, sys::generic_category() );
        return 0;
    }

    ssize_t r = ::read( fd_, buffer, size );

    if( r < 0 )
    {
        ec.assign( errno, sys::system_category() );
        return 0;
    }

    ec = {}; // ec.clear(); under C++03
    return r;
}
```

In this case, since we're returning the fixed `errno` value `EINVAL`, which
is part of the portable subset defined by the generic category, we mark the
error value in `ec` as belonging to the generic category.

It's possible to use system as well, as `EINVAL` is also a system category
value under POSIX; however, using the generic category for values belonging
to the portable `errno` subset is slightly preferrable.

Our implementation of `file::write` needs to uindergo a similar treatment.
There, however, we'll apply another change. When there's no space left on
the disk, `::write` returns a number of bytes written that is lower than
what we requested with `size`, but our function signals no error. We'll make
it return `ENOSPC` in this case.

```
std::size_t file::write( void const * buffer, std::size_t size, sys::error_code& ec )
{
    if( size > SSIZE_MAX )
    {
        ec.assign( EINVAL, sys::generic_category() );
        return 0;
    }

    ssize_t r = ::write( fd_, buffer, size );

    if( r < 0 )
    {
        ec.assign( errno, sys::system_category() );
        return 0;
    }

    if( r < size )
    {
        ec.assign( ENOSPC, sys::system_category() );
    }
    else
    {
        ec = {}; // ec.clear(); under C++03
    }

    return r;
}
```

We've used the system category to make it appear that the `ENOSPC` value
has come from the `::write` API, mostly to illustrate that this is also a
possible approach. Using a generic value would have worked just as well.

## Returning Specific Errors under Windows

Not much to say; the situation under Windows is exactly the same. The only
difference is that we _must_ use the generic category for returning `errno`
values. The system category does not work; the integer values in the system
category are entirely different from those in the generic category.

```
std::size_t file::read( void * buffer, std::size_t size, sys::error_code& ec )
{
    DWORD r = 0;

    if( size > MAXDWORD )
    {
        ec.assign( EINVAL, sys::generic_category() );
    }
    else if( ::ReadFile( fh_, buffer, size, &r, 0 ) )
    {
        ec = {}; // ec.clear(); under C++03
    }
    else
    {
        ec.assign( ::GetLastError(), sys::system_category() );
    }

    return r;
}

std::size_t file::write( void const * buffer, std::size_t size, sys::error_code& ec )
{
    DWORD r = 0;

    if( size > MAXDWORD )
    {
        ec.assign( EINVAL, sys::generic_category() );
    }
    else if( ::WriteFile( fh_, buffer, size, &r, 0 ) )
    {
        if( r < size )
        {
            ec.assign( ENOSPC, sys::generic_category() );
        }
        else
        {
            ec = {}; // ec.clear(); under C++03
        }
    }
    else
    {
        ec.assign( ::GetLastError(), sys::system_category() );
    }

    return r;
}
```

## Attaching a Source Location to Error Codes

Unlike the standard `<system_error>`, Boost.System allows source locations
(file:line:function) to be stored in `error_code`, so that functions handling
the error can display or log the source code location where the error occurred.
To take advantage of this functionality, our POSIX `file::read` function needs
to be augmented as follows:

```
std::size_t file::read( void * buffer, std::size_t size, sys::error_code& ec )
{
    if( size > SSIZE_MAX )
    {
        static constexpr boost::source_location loc = BOOST_CURRENT_LOCATION;
        ec.assign( EINVAL, sys::generic_category(), &loc );
        return 0;
    }

    ssize_t r = ::read( fd_, buffer, size );

    if( r < 0 )
    {
        static constexpr boost::source_location loc = BOOST_CURRENT_LOCATION;
        ec.assign( errno, sys::system_category(), &loc );
        return 0;
    }

    ec = {}; // ec.clear(); under C++03
    return r;
}
```

That is, before every `ec.assign` statement, we need to declare a
`static constexpr` variable holding the current source location, then pass
a pointer to it to `assign`. Since `error_code` is small and there's no space
in it for more than a pointer, we can't just store the `source_location` in it
by value.

`BOOST_CURRENT_LOCATION` is a macro expanding to the current source location
(a combination of `++__FILE__++`, `++__LINE__++`, and `BOOST_CURRENT_FUNCTION`.)
It's defined and documented in link:../../../assert/index.html[Boost.Assert].

Under {cpp}03, instead of `static constexpr`, one needs to use `static const`.
Another option is `BOOST_STATIC_CONSTEXPR`, a
link:../../../config/index.html[Boost.Config] macro that expands to either
`static constexpr` or `static const`, as appropriate.

To avoid repeating this boilerplate each time we do `ec.assign`, we can define
a macro:

```
#define ASSIGN(ec, ...) { \
    BOOST_STATIC_CONSTEXPR boost::source_location loc = BOOST_CURRENT_LOCATION; \
    (ec).assign(__VA_ARGS__, &loc); }
```

which we can now use to augment, for example, the POSIX implementation of `file::write`:

```
std::size_t file::write( void const * buffer, std::size_t size, sys::error_code& ec )
{
    if( size > SSIZE_MAX )
    {
        ASSIGN( ec, EINVAL, sys::generic_category() );
        return 0;
    }

    ssize_t r = ::write( fd_, buffer, size );

    if( r < 0 )
    {
        ASSIGN( ec, errno, sys::system_category() );
        return 0;
    }

    if( r < size )
    {
        ASSIGN( ec, ENOSPC, sys::generic_category() );
    }
    else
    {
        ec = {}; // ec.clear(); under C++03
    }

    return r;
}
```

## Obtaining Textual Representations of Error Codes for Logging and Display

Assuming that we have an `error_code` instance `ec`, returned to us by some
function, we have a variety of means to obtain textual representations of the
error code represented therein.

`ec.to_string()` gives us the result of streaming `ec` into a `std::ostream`,
e.g. if `std::cout << ec << std::endl;` outputs `system:6`, this is what
`ec.to_string()` will return. (`system:6` under Windows is `ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE`
from `<winerror.h>`.)

To obtain a human-readable error message corresponding to this code, we can
use `ec.message()`. For `ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE`, it would give us "The handle is
invalid" - possibly localized.

If `ec` contains a source location, we can obtain its textual representation
via `ec.location().to_string()`. This will give us something like

```text
C:\Projects\testbed2019\testbed2019.cpp:98 in function 'unsigned __int64 __cdecl file::read(void *,unsigned __int64,class boost::system::error_code &)'
```

if there is a location in `ec`, and

```text
(unknown source location)
```

if there isn't. (`ec.has_location()` is `true` when `ec` contains a location.)

Finally, `ec.what()` will give us a string that contains all of the above,
something like

```text
The handle is invalid [system:6 at C:\Projects\testbed2019\testbed2019.cpp:98 in function 'unsigned __int64 __cdecl file::read(void *,unsigned __int64,class boost::system::error_code &)']
```

Most logging and diagnostic output that is not intended for the end user would
probably end up using `what()`. (`ec.what()`, augmented with the prefix
supplied at construction, is also what `boost::system::system_error::what()`
would return.)

## Composing Functions Returning Error Codes

Let's suppose that we need to implement a file copy function, with the following
interface:

```
std::size_t file_copy( file& src, file& dest, sys::error_code& ec );
```

`file_copy` uses `src.read` to read bytes from `src`, then writes these bytes
to `dest` using `dest.write`. This continues until one of these operations signals
an error, or until end of file is reached. It returns the number of bytes written,
and uses `ec` to signal an error.

Here is one possible implementation:

```
std::size_t file_copy( file& src, file& dest, sys::error_code& ec )
{
    std::size_t r = 0;

    for( ;; )
    {
        unsigned char buffer[ 1024 ];

        std::size_t n = src.read( buffer, sizeof( buffer ), ec );

        // read failed, leave the error in ec and return
        if( ec.failed() ) return r;

        // end of file has been reached, exit loop
        if( n == 0 ) return r;

        r += dest.write( buffer, n, ec );

        // write failed, leave the error in ec and return
        if( ec.failed() ) return r;
    }
}
```

Note that there is no longer any difference between POSIX and Windows
implementations; their differences are contained in `file::read` and
`file::write`. `file_copy` is portable and works under any platform.

The general pattern in writing such higher-level functions is that
they pass the output `error_code` parameter `ec` they received from
the caller directly as the output parameter to the lower-level functions
they are built upon. This way, when they detect a failure in an intermediate
operation (by testing `ec.failed()`), they can immediately return to the
caller, because the error code is already in its proper place.

Note that `file_copy` doesn't even need to clear `ec` on success, by
using `ec = {};`. Since we've already tested `ec.failed()`, we know that
`ec` contains a value that means success.

## Providing Dual (Throwing and Nonthrowing) Overloads

Functions that signal errors via an output `error_code& ec` parameter
require that the caller check `ec` after calling them, and take appropriate
action (such as return immediately, as above.) Forgetting to check `ec`
results in logic errors.

While this is a preferred coding style for some, others prefer exceptions,
which one cannot forget to check.

An approach that has been introduced by
link:../../../filesystem/index.html[Boost.Filesystem] (which later turned
into `std::filesystem`) is to provide both alternatives: a nonthrowing
function taking `error_code& ec`, as `file_copy` above, and a throwing
function that does not take an `error_code` output parameter, and throws
exceptions on failure.

This is how this second throwing function is typically implemented:

```
std::size_t file_copy( file& src, file& dest )
{
    sys::error_code ec;
    std::size_t r = file_copy( src, dest, ec );

    if( ec.failed() ) throw sys::system_error( ec, __func__ );

    return r;
}
```

That is, we simply call the nonthrowing overload of `file_copy`, and if
it signals failure in `ec`, throw a `system_error` exception.

We use our function name `++__func__++` (`file_copy`) as the prefix, although
that's a matter of taste.

Note that typically under this style the overloads taking `error_code& ec`
are decorated with `noexcept`, so that it's clear that they don't throw
exceptions (although we haven't done so in the preceding examples in order
to keep the code {cpp}03-friendly.)

## result<T> as an Alternative to Dual APIs

Instead of providing two functions for every operation, an alternative
approach is to make the function return `sys::result<T>` instead of `T`.
`result<T>` is a class holding either `T` or `error_code`, similar to
link:../../../variant2/index.html[`variant<T, error_code>`].

Clients that prefer to check for errors and not rely on exceptions can
test whether a `result<T> r` contains a value via `if( r )` or its more
verbose equivalent `if( r.has_value() )`, then obtain the value via
`*r` or `r.value()`. If `r` doesn't contain a value, the `error_code`
it holds can be obtained with `r.error()`.

Those who prefer exceptions just call `r.value()` directly, without
checking. In the no-value case, this will automatically throw a
`system_error` corresponding to the `error_code` in `r`.

Assuming our base `file` API is unchanged, this variation of `file_copy`
would look like this:

```
sys::result<std::size_t> file_copy( file& src, file& dest )
{
    std::size_t r = 0;
    sys::error_code ec;

    for( ;; )
    {
        unsigned char buffer[ 1024 ];

        std::size_t n = src.read( buffer, sizeof( buffer ), ec );

        if( ec.failed() ) return ec;
        if( n == 0 ) return r;

        r += dest.write( buffer, n, ec );

        if( ec.failed() ) return ec;
    }
}
```

The only difference here is that we return `ec` on error, instead of
`r`.

Note, however, that we can no longer return both an error code and a
number of transferred bytes; that is, we can no longer signal _partial
success_. This is often not an issue at higher levels, but lower-level
primitives such as `file::read` and `file::write` might be better off
written using the old style.

Nevertheless, to demonstrate how `result` returning APIs are composed,
we'll show how `file_copy` would look if `file::read` and `file::write`
returned `result<size_t>`:

```
class file
{
public:

    // ...

    sys::result<std::size_t> read( void * buffer, std::size_t size );
    sys::result<std::size_t> write( void const * buffer, std::size_t size );
};

sys::result<std::size_t> file_copy( file& src, file& dest )
{
    std::size_t m = 0;

    for( ;; )
    {
        unsigned char buffer[ 1024 ];

        auto r = src.read( buffer, sizeof( buffer ) );
        if( !r ) return r;

        std::size_t n = *r;
        if( n == 0 ) return m;

        auto r2 = dest.write( buffer, n );
        if( !r2 ) return r2;

        std::size_t n2 = *r2;
        m += n2;
    }
}
```
